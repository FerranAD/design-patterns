  Design Patterns üìö 
</h1>

Here's a collection of design patterns that I've implemented following the [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/) book. My goal for this repo is to have a brief pattern catalog that I can refer to when needed.

Ilustrations are from the [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog).

## Creational üî®

_Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code._

### Factory method

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface
for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method __lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses__.

By replacing `new Product()` with a call to `createProduct()`, the (abstract) superclass can operate with the object to be created. Only when a subclass is instantiated, some kind of concrete product will be actually created.

### Abstract factory

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface
for __creating families of related or dependent objects__
without specifying their concrete classes.

Abstract factories are usually formed by a set of factory methods. By returning the abstract type of the concrete products, they decouple the client from concrete product implementations.

### Singleton

The Singleton pattern lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. We can achieve that just by making the class constructor private, and adding a static method to get the unique instance (adding locks would be necessary if concurrency can happen).

Singletons __can often lead to bad designs__ if used improperly, they are hard to test and can be problematic on multithreaded environments. So they really must be used only when needed (to access a database for example).

### Builder

The Builder pattern lets you __construct complex objects step by step__. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

It's also useful for avoiding giant constructors and creating complex objects.

## Structural üèóÔ∏è

_Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient._

### Facade

By __defining a higher-level interface__, the Facade pattern provides easier access to a particular part of the subsystem‚Äôs functionality. It knows where to direct the client‚Äôs request.

**Avoid creating a god object**. If needed, additional facades can be made either to be used independently or to be composed with a higher-level facade (so the latter can maintain cohesiveness).

### Adapter

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class
into another interface the clients expect. It lets
classes work together that couldn‚Äôt otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces.

<h5 align = center> <img align="center" src="/img/uml-adapter.png" height="83%" width="83%"/> </h5>

Notice that Facade defines a new interface for existing objects, whereas Adapter tries to make the existing interface usable. Adapter usually wraps just one object, while Facade works with an entire subsystem of objects.

### Decorator (or wrapper)

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically (at runtime).
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.

The wrapper contains the same set of methods as the target and delegates to it all requests it receives. However, the wrapper may alter the result by **doing something either before or after it passes the request to the target.**

### Composite

The Composite Pattern allows you to
compose objects into tree structures to
represent **part-whole hierarchies**. Composite
lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.

### Proxy

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or
placeholder for another object to **control access** to it.

If you need to **execute something either before or after the primary logic of the class**, the proxy lets you do this without changing that class. Since the proxy implements the same interface as the original class, it can be passed to any client that expects a real service object.

<h5 align = center> <img align="center" src="/img/uml-proxy.png" height="46%" width="46%"/> </h5>

Use the Proxy
Pattern to create a
representative object
that controls access
to another object,
which may be remote,
expensive to create, or
in need of securing.

## Behavioral üó£Ô∏è

_Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects._

### Template method

The Template Method pattern suggests that you **break down an algorithm** into a series of steps, turn these steps into methods, and put a series of calls to these **methods inside a single template method**. The steps may either be `abstract`, or have some default implementation. The algorithm is completed by subclassing and overriding some optional steps if needed (but not the template method itself).

<h5 align = center> <img align="center" src="/img/uml-template-method.png" height="42%" width="42%"/> </h5>

**Hooks** can be very useful, they are methods that **give a point of extension of the algorithm**, but that are not needed for the algorithm to work. An example is the `onCreate()` method on *Android Activity*, which lets the client do something before
(or after) an important step.


### Iterator

The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an *iterator*.

<h5 align = center> <img align="center" src="/img/uml-iterator.png" height="42%" width="42%"/> </h5>

This **makes the client code compatible with any collection type or any traversal algorithm** as long as there‚Äôs a proper iterator. If you need a special way to traverse a collection, you just create a new iterator class, without having to change the collection or the client.

### Strategy

The Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific in a lot of different ways and **extract all of these algorithms into separate classes** called strategies.

The original class, called context, must have a field for storing a reference to one of the strategies. The context **delegates the work to a linked strategy object which can be changed at runtime**, and also used by other contexts.

<h5 align = center> <img align="center" src="/img/uml-strategy.png" height="42%" width="42%"/> </h5>

Remember that if you only have a couple of algorithms and they rarely change, there‚Äôs no real reason to overcomplicate the program. Also keep in mind that functional typing and **anonymous functions can provide the same results**, avoiding the need to bloat with new classes and interfaces.
